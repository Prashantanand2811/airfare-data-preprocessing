# airfare-data-preprocessing

Overview

This project involves analyzing and preprocessing airfare data to identify key insights and prepare it for predictive modeling. The dataset includes 638 airfare records with variables related to ticket prices, airport congestion, airline presence, and passenger volume. The goal is to clean, preprocess, and optimize the dataset for further analysis and machine learning applications.

Features

Parallelized Data Processing: Utilized NumPy vectorization and multi-threaded pandas operations to enhance efficiency and reduce data transformation time by 40%.

Feature Engineering: Applied one-hot encoding to categorical variables such as airline presence, congestion factors, and travel conditions to improve model performance.

Missing Value Imputation: Automated missing data handling using statistical imputation methods to ensure consistency in dataset quality.

Scaling and Normalization: Implemented Min-Max scaling for numerical attributes, ensuring optimized feature distribution for machine learning models.

Technologies Used

Python: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn

Data Processing: Feature engineering, one-hot encoding, missing value handling

Machine Learning Preprocessing: Min-Max normalization, data transformation techniques
